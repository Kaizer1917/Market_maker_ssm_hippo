# Configure SSM-HIPPO parameters
model_args = ModelArgs(
    d_model=128,          # Model dimension
    n_layer=4,            # Number of SSM layers
    seq_len=96,           # Input sequence length
    forecast_len=32,      # Prediction horizon
    num_channels=24,      # Number of market features
    patch_len=16,         # Patch size for processing
    stride=8              # Stride for patch sampling
)

# Initialize with custom configuration
